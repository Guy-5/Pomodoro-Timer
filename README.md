# Introduction
Hello and welcome! This was my first personal project I worked on. It may not be the best thing ever coded; however, it got the job done, was a great learning experience, and is something I still use when I need to be productive. I plan on creating a newer version in the future.<br>
# Pomodoro-Timer
This is a timer programmed in Java utilizing the Pomodoro Method.\
It includes:
- Study Timer: 25 Minutes
- Short Break Timer: 5 Minutes
- Long Break Timer: 15 Minutes
- Text area to add tasks to be completed for the session

There is an alarm to notify you when the timer is done.

Once the timer finishes, it will automatically start the next one. If on the study timer, it will default to a short break. After three short breaks, it will default to a long break. After each break ends, it will default to the study timer.

The application cannot be resized dynamically, as there was no need for it—the timer doesn’t need to occupy the entire screen. A widget was added so the timer can be minimized and still show in real time."
