# Pomodoro-Timer

# Introduction
This is a timer programmed in Java utilizing the Pomodoro Method.\
It includes:
- Study Timer: 25 Minutes
- Short Break Timer: 5 Minutes
- Long Break Timer: 15 Minutes

  
There is a beep to let you know when the timer is done. There will be an actual alarm used instead of this beep in the future.

Once done the timer will automatically start the next timer, if on study it will default to short break, after 3 short breaks it will default to a long break. After every break ends it will default to the study timer.

# Future
- Add an actual timer instead of using beep.
